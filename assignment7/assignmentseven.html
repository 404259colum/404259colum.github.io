  <p>Alien world domination will come where humans least expect it! Candy cams is the perfect name for the cover for their otherworldly operations. Humans love sweet treats, and what could be sweeter than sexy guys?! Humans already accomplished half the work load, the internet is a landfill of fake AI generated people each containing the illusion of authentic individuals. What better way to study humans than using their own technology against them? Or is it really their technology… Let's be real, AI is not a human invention! It was created by aliens to study and test the many different ways human thought could be broken down into different segments of thought. We cannot let aliens seduce humankind into world domination!</p>
    <p>There are countless bustling nights on the gay cam boy site, Candy Cams. Viewers tune in daily to watch their favorite performers. Within the last two years, our studies have measured daily traffic of over 1.3 million users! However what viewers don’t know is that behind the scenes, a group of aliens are frantically studying our human behavior. This site is their cover, a way to observe humans in our most intimate moments. The aliens chose the site for its anonymity and the freedom it provided for us humans to express our true selves. As every night comes to an end, the aliens silently log off, their minds filled with new knowledge and understanding of humans. They can’t wait to share their findings with their own species, hoping it would bring them one step closer to understanding the complexities of human nature.</p>
