<h1>The Saddle Bag - Logan Pedraza</h1>

<p>I think John Galliano's saddle bag has to be one of the most designer handbags. I believe often times the birkin is ranked first when it comes to handbags due to its notoriety for its high price. Saddle bags however, have a more whimsicle silhouette, and some of their editions can cost upwards of a plain birkin. The John Galliano Saddle bags for instance were inspired by various countries are in such high demand, they are impossible to find unless resourced through a boutique buyer. Another example of a priceless dior saddle bag would be the Soryama collaboration in which some of them cost upwards of 30,000 dollars.</p>
<p>The Dior Saddle Bag defined the early 2000's y2k movement and has been worn by an endless celebrities including the iconic duo Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. The saddle bag maintains a versality to it that the birkin lacks. I think a big reason for this is the number of different patterns and styles. The saddle bag ranges from punky graphics like the Back Beat pattern, or the Adiorable blue velvet Adiorable Saddle bag to a classic more lowkey simple solid black calf-skin style. My personal favorite is the iconic 2004 Diorbissimo Rasta Saddle bag adorning the iconic Dior monogram in addition to red yellow green trimming/stripes, and silver hardware.</p>
<p>Lastly, the dior saddle bag is unique to the brand whereas the Birkin or general hermes style has been replicated in other brands such as Prada's Medium leather handbag, Saint Laurent's Sac Jour Nano, and Celine's Conti bag. All of these bags contain the signature tassle and lock, a box like shape, and ressemble a belt strap at the top of the bag. The saddle bag's silhouette is unique to Dior and its organic shape has never been apropriated by any other designer brand.

    <p>The Birkin bag is undoubtedly the most iconic handbag in the fashion world. Jean-Louis Dumas — then artistic director and CEO of Hermès — conceptualized it in 1984 when he noticed British actress and singer Jane Birkin rummaging through her oversize wicker basket on a plane. When she tried placing it in the overhead compartment, all of her belongings spilled out. As Dumas helped her, he joked that she needed a more secure handbag for carrying all her belongings. Birkin then described her vision of the perfect bag, both spacious and stylish, as Dumas sketched away. A year later, Hermès released the first Birkin bag, named after the actress. And today it is one of the most difficult bags to acquire and has an incredibly high resale value. “Everybody wants a Birkin,” says Judy Taylor, president and CEO of Madison Avenue Couture, a reseller that specializes in the highest-quality Hermès handbags.</p>
    <p>Hermès designed the Birkin bag to be worn on the wrist or forearm. It has two top handles, a square silhouette, a front-facing lock closure, as well as a lock and set of keys. The Birkin bag has metal feet, called “clou,” so it remains upright even when placed on a surface, and the clou protect the bottom. The main variants for hardware are gold plating or palladium. Inside, it has a large patch pocket and a zip pocket. The price of a classic leather Birkin bag ranges from $10,400 to $12,500 at retail, depending on the size. And it’s nearly impossible to walk into an Hermès boutique and purchase one unless you are a high-spending client. For this reason, many people purchase Birkin bags on the secondhand market, usually at a steep price increase.
    </p>
    <p>Since its release, Hermès has reinvented this icon in different leathers, exotic skins, and limited-edition designs. Togo leather, a more supple type of calfskin leather, is a popular option because of its vertical grain texture, matte appearance, and scratch resistance, says Taylor. Another prominent leather option is Epsom leather because it is firm and maintains the Birkin’s shape over time, as well as being waterproof and scratch-resistant. According to Lucy Bishop, handbag and fashion specialist at Sotheby’s, “calf leather Hermès bags are a great starting point and staple piece to any collection.” Bishop also tells us that Birkin bags in earth-tone colors are particularly covetable, a fabulous option being the Gold Epsom Birkin 25 Sellier Gold Hardware.
