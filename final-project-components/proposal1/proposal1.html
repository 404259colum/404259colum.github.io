          It was a bustling night on the gay cam boy site, Candy Cams, as viewers tuned in to watch their favorite performers. What they didn't know was that behind the scenes, a group of aliens were frantically studying human behavior. The site was their cover, a way to observe humans in their most intimate moments. The aliens had chosen the site for its anonymity and the freedom it provided for individuals to express their true selves. As they watched the performers interact with their viewers, the aliens were amazed by the range of human emotions on display. But as the night went on, they couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for the connections and relationships that seemed to exist between the performers and their viewers. They had never experienced such raw and genuine human connections before. With every night coming to an end, the aliens silently log off, their minds filled with new knowledge and understanding of humans. They couldn't wait to share their findings with their own species, hoping it would bring them one step closer to understanding the complexities of human nature. Alien world domination will come where humans least expect it!</p>
      <p>Candy cams was the perfect name for the cover for their operations. Humans love sweet treats, especially sexy guys! The website is littered with candy wrappers, bright capturing colors, and countless options of profiles to explore. Thankfully, humans already accomplished half the work load, the internet is a landfill of fake AI generated people each containing the illusion of authentic individuals. What better way to study humans than using their own technology against them? Or is it really their technology… Let's be real, AI is not a human invention! It was created by aliens to study and test the many different ways human thought could be broken down into different segments of thought.</p> 
<p>I chose a cam website as the setting for this fictitious truth because of the many graphic design elements that are required for its success.
    People log onto these websites in order to immerse themselves in a sexual fantasy and I think it’s very interesting to play around with this idea of world building. Cam websites are the perfect opportunity for me to create something kitschy and whimsical while still maintaining a sense of function. For this reason I believe it also allows me the freedom to play around with stylistic choices behind the formatting of a website. Additionally, when it comes to a gay cam website, I am opening up a door to mess around with personifying homosexuality in the context of advertising and my mind is immediately drawn to iconic gay erotica artists including Tom of Finland, Dom Orejudos, Ivan Bubentcov.</p>
      <p>The fictitious organization is described in the narrative above, it revolves around an alien collective using their own technology (AI) to study the inner workings of human emotion in order to mimic their behavior and integrate themselves in earthly society. The aliens are using a fictional cam site in order to spy on humans and learn from their private behaviors so they can seduce mankind into world domination! Additionally, the fictitious truth could potentially become a “benevolent truth” because it brings up conversations about internet privacy, and AI’s access to data. It questions how much of our online data is being sold for capitalistic means, and furthermore where does it go? What is the value of our data, and is it important to be aware of what happens to it? Finally, how close is too close when it comes to AI mimicking human behavior, and where does the public draw the line for AI advancement.</p>
