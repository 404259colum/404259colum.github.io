          My Style Guide was designed to convey captivating color that are hard to look away similar to advertising onthe los vegas strip. These colors were meant be similar to the fantastical atmosphere of candy packaging in order emphasize the kitchsy nature behind a camboy site. I chose this theme because I find the design behind candy packages as flirting a consumer to purchase something they don't really need, but desire. On another note, I think today's generation has more acceptance when it comes to sexual appeal, and even praises it. I think of sex positive shows like Girls Next Door, Anna Nicole Smith, and Queer  as Folk that have shaped today's views on embracing sexual appeal as on trend and wanted to run with that from a design stand point.</p>
