<p class="paragraph">Alien world domination will come where humans least expect it! Candy cams is the perfect name for the cover for their otherworldly operations. Humans love sweet treats, and what could be sweeter than sexy guys?! Humans already accomplished half the work load, the internet is a landfill of fake AI generated people each containing the illusion of authentic individuals. What better way to study humans than using their own technology against them? Or is it really their technologyâ€¦ Let's be real, AI is not a human invention! It was created by aliens to study and test the many different ways human thought could be broken down into different segments of thought. We cannot let aliens seduce humankind into world domination!</p>
