        <p class="paragraph">There are countless bustling nights on the gay cam boy site, Candy Cams. Viewers tune in
            daily to watch their favorite performers. Within the last two years, our studies have measured daily traffic
            of over 1.3 million users! However what viewers don’t know is that behind the scenes, a group of aliens are
            frantically studying our human behavior. This site is their cover, a way to observe humans in our most
            intimate moments. The aliens chose the site for its anonymity and the freedom it provided for us humans to
            express our true selves. As every night comes to an end, the aliens silently log off, their minds filled
            with new knowledge and understanding of humans. They can’t wait to share their findings with their own
            species, hoping it would bring them one step closer to understanding the complexities of human nature.</p>
